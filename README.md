# Space Game
 Space Game is developed in interpreted, high-level, general-purpose language, Python IDE. Python is well-known as clear language that is beneficial for programmer to write logical code such as large-scale projects like Space Game. This language is also described as "batteries included" which mean it has comprehensive standard library. Space Game was implemented within multiple libraries such as pygame, os, time and random libraries. This easily readalbe language support English keywords and uses whitespace identiation which strength accuracy of Space Game's semantic structure except using the brackets. For example, common method "continue" statement in line 286 and 353 will skips specific iteration and continues with the next item as it is stated. This program has arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, and % to devise multiple masthematics such as healthbar and object collision identificaiton.

## Prerequisites

* Python (3.8.2)
* Pygame (1.9.1)
* Visual Studio Code (Recommended but not obligatory)

## Installing

Step One : Clone the repo without checking out a work tree.
```
git clone -n <repo-url>
```
Step Two : check out the file.
```
git checkout master -- path/within/repo/to/file
```

## Running the tests

* Run main.py to implement the program moving player ship object. It can controlled by pressing a(left),d(right),w(up),s(down) and space(shoot) key. As the space key is pressed, player ship shoots the lasers to remove enemy object as it is collided. As the enemies are all removed in the stage where player is in, player can step into next level. There are boss rounds as the player reaches to the level multiple of 3. Boss is upsized that are supposed to be the original. It shoots the dual bullet that threat player ship object.

## Break down into end to end tests

No Break down into end to end tests required.

## And coding style tests

No coding style tests required.

## Built With

* Python (3.8.2) : Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
* Pygame (1.9.1) : Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.
* Visual Studio Code : Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes embedded Git and support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality. The source code is free and open-source, released under the permissive MIT License. The compiled binaries are freeware for any use.
